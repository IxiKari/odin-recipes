    <h2>Dim Sum Shrimp Dumplings</h2>
      <p>The Dim Sum tables are filled with many plates displaying all sorts of
      flavors, but one of the most popular items on the table I would say is the
      "xia jiao" or "har gow" in Cantonese. That might be a little biased, though,
       because they happen to be one of my favorites. They are these beautiful crystal
      white dumplings stuffed with steamed shrimp.</crystal-></p>
      <p>This Dim Sum dish is easy to love but difficult to follow</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <h4>For The Filling</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound raw shrimp</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 cup bamboo shoots</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>For The Dough</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup of wheat starch</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups of boiling water</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons lard</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <h4>For The Filling</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Mix everything (except the bamboo) together; whip in one direction 
              for a few minutes until the mixture starts to look sticky. Now add the 
              chopped bamboo shoots, and mix everything together. Cover and refrigerate
               while preparing the dough.</li>
              </ol>
          <h4>For the Dough</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Mix the wheat starch and cornstarch in a mixing bowl. Slowly add in 
              the boiling water, while stirring rapidly. Now add in the lard (or oil) 
              and continue to stir. Knead the dough for a couple of minutes, until it 
              turns into a smooth dough ball. Roll the dough into a long cylinder, and 
              divide it into 18 equal pieces. Cover the dough pieces with a damp paper 
              towel.</li>
            </ol>
          <h4>To Assemble And Cook The Dumplings</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Turn on the stove to pre-boil the water in the steamer. Take one 
                piece of dough and roll it into a 3‚Äù diameter circle. Add a spoonful 
                of filling and fold the dumpling as shown in our video. Continue 
                assembling until all the dumplings are made.</li>
              <li>Once the water in the steamer is boiled, steam the shrimp dumplings 
                for 6 minutes using high heat and serve hot. Make sure that they each
                 have an inch and a half to expand during the cooking process.</li>
