    <h2>Dim Sum Shrimp Dumplings</h2>
      <p>The Dim Sum tables are filled with many plates displaying all sorts of
      flavors, but one of the most popular items on the table I would say is the
      "xia jiao" or "har gow" in Cantonese. That might be a little biased, though,
       because they happen to be one of my favorites. They are these beautiful crystal
      white dumplings stuffed with steamed shrimp.</crystal-></p>
      <p>This Dim Sum dish is easy to love but difficult to follow</p>
